        <h1>All Things Open Conference 10/23 - 10/24</h1>
          <div>
            <p class="lead">
              Just finished attending and speaking at the first ever All Things Open conference.  It was a great first time event in Raleigh, NC.  There were over 800 people registered.  The format was split into 4 tracks, Development, Operations, Business, and Emerging.  Each talk was 45 minutes long and there were plenty to choose from.  Most talks, that I was able to attend were informative and constructive.  Unfortunately, I only got to hear one keynote.  From the Redhat CIO.
            </p>
          <h2>RedHat Keynote</h2>
          <p>
It is truly amazing that Redhat has been open for 20 years and is a billion a year revenue giant, all based on open source and the support and services of open source software.  They are in the process of moving as much of their IT to the cloud, and plan to be about 80% in the cloud in 2 years.  From what I know, they do a great job of interacting and working with the open source communities.  I few months ago, I had the honor to speak at the Fedora conference and the Redhat interaction was phenominal.  Looking forward to seeing how they transition from tranditional IT to the Cloud and the future.
           </p>
           <h2>AngularJS/EmberJS Talks</h2>
           <p>
            On the second day of the event, there were two back to back talks on AngularJS (my talk) and EmberJS.  The feedback I got was both talks went well and much of the audience was very excited to be able to look at both technologies in the same time frame as well as ask questions about each.  The EmberJS session had about 15 minutes of excellent QA and I think there was a lot of momentum built while the crowd appears to be very interested in these technoloiges.
